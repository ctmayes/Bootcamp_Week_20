# Joint Savings

This program is designed to create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.


## Technologies

In the screenshot below we can clearly see use of the deposit function to send 1 ether as wei.

![deposit1](/Execution_Results/deposit_1.PNG)

In the screenshot below we can clearly see use of the deposit function to send 10 ether as wei.

![deposit2](/Execution_Results/deposit_2.PNG)

In the screenshot below we can clearly see use of the deposit function to send 5 ether.

![deposit3](/Execution_Results/deposit_3.PNG)

In the screenshot below we can clearly see use of the withdraw function to withdraw 5 ether into accountOne.
